I was looking a [Lorenzo](http://www.alberton.info/)'s [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/quipo/nosql-databases-why-what-and-when) (slide 50)  and found a very interesting and hypnotic photo. I stole it from his slides and made it into my desktop wall paper, I really like the effects this image has on the eyes... Making a flat 2D image seem so 3D without all the fancy this and that.
So without further ado:
