I've been out for over a month. Exams all through May, birthday June 4th and a decent holiday break in a few days...

Its been interesting, missed out a lot of new development with Cassandra 0.8 being released and all.
I'm going to be checking out stuff today to see how much I've missed. Planning to do a few tutorials on CQL before holiday break.

Not to mention, I start a new job on the 1st of July. I finally got a placement with an amazing tech company in Reading...
That's goin to be exciting, I can't wait to start.

Well, simple, short, sweet...I'll be posting again soon once I'm up to speed on what I've missed.
