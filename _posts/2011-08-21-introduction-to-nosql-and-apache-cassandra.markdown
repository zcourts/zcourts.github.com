A while back (April 2011) I wrote an article that I wanted to publish on Sitepoint but I guess they didn't like it because I haven't had a reply back. I was just randomly cleaning up my mail and found it in my sent messages folder.

I've published it on [Script and Scroll](http://www.scriptandscroll.com),underÂ [Introduction to NoSQL](http://www.scriptandscroll.com/3508/technology/nosql-not-only-sql-introduction-to-apache-cassandra/), while it was written months ago it is still perfectly relevant and could serve as a good starting point for a beginner interested in getting started with Cassandra and the whole NoSQL idea.

I'll be interested in getting any feedback on it so, have a quick read and mail me your thoughts on it :-).
