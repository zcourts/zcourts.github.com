WARNING: I am going to rant. I am going to swear. This is very off topic to my usual posts, if you're going to be offended by me swearing or slagging off the London MET or UK Government, STOP reading now because I will not apologise for it and chances are if you nag me about being explicit I'll tell you to bugger off. And that's me putting it politely...

<!-- more -->I drive you pull me over every mile, I walk, you stop me all the while. The [London metropolitan](http://content.met.police.uk/) police is a set of racist fucks. I'm contracting/freelancing while building my start up. I was on the way home last night from my current contract and got stopped and searched :O .

Let's get one thing straight, I wear a jeans and T-shirt wherever and whenever I want. Seriously, most people get into the tech industry because it's a thing we do. So no, I won't dress up in a suit to please you, no I won't apologise for working until whatever time I want. Up yours! If I won't dress up to attend my own meetings why the hell would I dress up to prevent you people treating me like a criminal! I wasn't even going to attend my own graduation next month because they expect me to wear that ridiculous robe, only reason I changed my mind is because my dad's flying almost 5000 miles to come see me graduate!
I am a very no bullshit kind of person. If the answer to a question can simply be "yes" or "no" I would much rather you say it and shut up than give me a long ass explanation of why it has to be either. To give some background on where this got annoying, see this [Tweet](https://twitter.com/zcourts/status/261733649047773184) from last year.

Me getting pulled over became so annoying I changed my driving pattern, I went to Uni an hour or 2hrs earlier than usual, I stayed back and worked until later than I wanted and I generally avoided Greenwich and Lewisham main roads, opting instead for all the back roads the lovely Google Maps could dig out. It got the point where people didn't believe me any more until one early morning probably 2 days before Christmas last year my mum wanted to go to [Smithfield Market](http://www.smithfieldmarket.com/). Now this place opens at ridiculous o'clock in the morning so we were in the car with me driving at about 3am to get to this place, and wouldn't you know it, I got pulled over about 4 miles from our house going through Bromley. My mum, two brothers and my other half were in the car. This time, I didn't get a reason for being pulled over they asked for my license then radioed in and 2 mins later gave it back. No I don't speed, I'm convinced the moment they catch me speeding it'll be enough for me to get assaulted and harassed even further so I don't. I've made up my mind that if it gets to that point I'm just going to knock one of them the fuck out, that'll give you lot something to stop me for. That idiot pissed me off as well, asked where I was going and I said shopping, he looked at me and twisted his ugly face as if I was lying.
Now, I generally try to give everyone, no matter how blatantly obvious and stupid the thing is, the benefit of the doubt. There comes a point when you just need to wake up and realising people are just taking the piss now. And that's what the [London Met](https://twitter.com/metpoliceuk) is doing. I make it a point to avoid the bastards because you're either institutionally racist or the force just aim to hire the most racist bastards around. Either way the London met is just full of morons you want to punch. As the image above shows, I started driving last year and it's become common place for me to be pulled over for NOTHING. To this day I've not been given a good reason. I've had shitty excuses, at the start there were things like, oh your insurance hasn't shown up on our system yet, or the plates don't match the car. That got old real quick and now they just say something along the lines of oh it's just a "routine" check.  So it's routine for you to check me every week yes?

For anyone that knows me, I make it a point not to get involved with politics. To date I've seen one politician that has been able to say something without their every word not registering as a lie and me just there thinking "Lying bastard, if I could lock you up in a dungeon and have you scolded for every lie you just told, you'd be dead from that speech alone". It was a New Zealand dude giving a speech on a bill about [Gay marriage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18t-CUgMzt8) (video on YouTube), I've never seen another politician look so genuine so he's either a very good liar or a very genuine guy and I'm inclined to think he's just genuine.

Politics is annoying, I love the idea behind a democracy, philosophically it's great but do we really live in a democracy? I've come to the conclusion that it's all just a front and as far as I'm concerned the government is no better than an organised criminal gang. The only real difference is they can be criminals and it's legal. Whether we live in a true democracy or not is something I'll leave for the stoners and philosophers to argue about. I'll surely punch one of them if I were to debate the point with them! But seriously...

To the UK government and it's racist bastard of a police force. I have always been a law abiding citizen, I've never done drugs, I don't go on binge drinking sprees, I'm generally a guy working hard trying to make something of his life and I've always let you get on with matters that concern you because it never concerned me. You did your legally illegal, but legal job and I teach myself a load of different programming languages to do my job!

But you know what,  your job does concern me, because you're not doing what you're suppose to you shit heads! I'm thinking whether it'll be more fun to start an uprising and watch you roll around and cry or just be me and patiently work my way through you're crap fest and just run for prime minister. I can be a man of infinite patience if I want to be! So far I've decided a few things:

I'm going to become way more active in politics from now on, and no I'm not going to become some protester throwing bottles. Do I look like I have that kinda time? It's 2013, technology is at it's best and poised to get better. Lukily for me I can build just about any tech I put my mind to, unfortunately for you this means I'm going to aim to change the battle field. Forget protesting, marching, hunger strikes and the like (who has the time, plus hunger strike? I can't live without my chicken!). There's a time and place for everything and 2013 is not the place for such primitive things. Not for my generation anyway...

I'm going to build an app in the next few months that allows people to take pictures of police and other government officials being bastards and have you all named and shamed! I'm contemplating what else to build to aid my campaign, we'll see.

And no, I have no intention of breaking the law, how would that help me at all? I won't even contemplate hacking, hello, freedom of information act 2000! And yes the info I can get via that route is limited but I won't need any more than that!  I can think of a lot of things I can do with the skills I have that will make things that much more harder for you to get away with the shit you are.

When I manage to get your attention, yes not if I do, but when I do, I shall see to it you regret pissing me off! You know, this could have gone very differently, I honestly would rather not be involved in politics, if you hadn't been treating me like a criminal for being me none of this would have happened and I'd have just happily let you carry on being bastards in your own world. It's annoying enough being me sometimes, I am Jamaican and proud! But the downside of that is every other moron I meet who finds out I'm Jamaican assumes I smoke, assumes I like every Bob Marley song, assumes I'm in a gang or associate with some.

Building an app and other tech things to take a stand  is going to be more representative of who I am rather than who these idiots are trying to make me out to be. Aptly put by [Gareth](https://twitter.com/zcourts/status/350021035875246080).
