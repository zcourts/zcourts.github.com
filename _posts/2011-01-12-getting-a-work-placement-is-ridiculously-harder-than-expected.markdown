If you can maintain an 85+ average at University, you'd expect yourself to be able to get a work placement.




For the last few months I've been doing applications and it all seems to go well until I get to the selection stage and I'm asked to do a psycometric test.




During the test it feels fine, not difficult but to so far I've not been able to pass any of the 3, I completed.  

For my other applications I didn't even get that far...




Currently awaiting the outcome of my fourth psycometric test. Fingers crossed I get this one.




I may been missing something here but for the applications that didn't need a psycometric test, why didn't I even get to the interview stage?




What exactly are employers after these days?  

I work hard, have a solid interest in IT, I'm sociable, communicate well. The uni grades to back me up, extracurricular activities. Writing a book, starting a company, some work experience and the list goes on...




I'm so confused.... and convinced employers can't be pleased...
