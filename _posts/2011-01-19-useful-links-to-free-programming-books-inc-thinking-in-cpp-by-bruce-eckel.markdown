Just a quick post to mention a few useful links I came across today. Ever heard of  [Bruce Eckel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Eckel)? A legend, really...anyway, I found an interesting post on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) today. Its a [list of freely available programming/computer books](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/194812/list-of-freely-available-programming-books), and while going through the list I found really good books on C++ (I've been trying to learn it). One of those books happened to be Bruce Eckel's, [Thinking in C++, 2nd edition](http://www.mindview.net/Books/TICPP/ThinkingInCPP2e.html).

I just downloaded and about to start reading, but I've heard good things about him and his books/work so I'm hoping it will be a good read. So I thought I'd share.
