I'll be getting some free time over the next few weeks and I intend to put together a series of Cassandra Cheat Sheets. I've been wanting to for a while but haven't gotten round to it, so the following list are the individual sheets which target specific things relating to [Cassandra](cassandra.apache.org).



	
  1. [Cassandra Terminology](http://crlog.info/2011/12/25/cassandra-terminology-cheat-sheet/)

	
  2. Cassandra Query Language

	
  3. Cassandra Thrift API

	
  4. Cassandra Internals


I'll add more as I get time in pdf,html and doc format... The first cheat sheet is already being written.
