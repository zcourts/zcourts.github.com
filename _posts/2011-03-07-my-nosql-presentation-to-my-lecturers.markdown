It's been a mission in the making but this Thursday I finally get to do my NoSQL presentation to some of my lecturers, and I can't wait!!!

My presentation will be centered around the emergence of NoSQL DBs and where they're fitting in as well as how more if these technologies should be integrated in our courses to better equip us for working in the real world.<!-- more -->

As I've recently been interviewed mainly on the merit that I'm involved/using Apache Cassandra. Despite it not being very apparent to the public, many large companies, including banks are adapting and using NoSQL/Columnar DBs.

I'll post my slides on this post later after I've finished them.
