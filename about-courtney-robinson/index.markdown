I have a 1st class BEng Software Engineering degree from the University of Greenwich. [My CV](http://crlog.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/cv-1-8-doc.pdf) is available here but I'm not actively looking for a full time position at the minute. And please, no agencies.

I am currently the core developer behind [Fillta ](http://fillta.com/)and one of its Co-Founders. Exciting stuff happening! The team's taken the plunge and decided to slug it over the next year. We'll be releasing a beta for Dec 13/Jan 14 (depending on summer progress).

Previously did a placement year with [Datasift](http://www.datasift.com) (Awesome place to work, they're growing and hiring so if you're looking give em a shout...)

I've been doing and continue to do several bits and pieces ( of projects?) for a few years now. My latest pride and joy is [Higgs](https://github.com/zcourts/higgs), which is a by-product of Fillta.

Some I earn a bit of pocket change from, others I just do because it was an idea I came up with and thought it was cool. Few of my projects ever leave my local machine but I have thousands of lines of code from crawlers,parsers, to fully working services that power search engines... then I have random ones like a web based IDE....

All those things done in different languages, Java,C++,C,Javascript,PHP,C#,HTML(5), who knows I think I have some assembly stuff somewhere too.

I'm interested in high performance and/or distributed systems, NoSQL, Artificial Intelligence, Search engines/Information Retrieval and HCI. I've worked [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/) since 2008, not long after Facebook open sourced it. It's currently the main data store behind Fillta. Along with that I've done a fair amount of work with Hadoop/MapReduce, some with HBase (but I'm not a big fan).

I've recently worked with [Netty](http://netty.io/) a massive amount, [Higgs.IO](http://higgs.io/) is implemented on top of the new V4 API.  I'm currently helping Norman with the upcoming [Netty in Action](http://www.manning.com/maurer/) book that'll be available later this year from Manning.

I love watching and playing cricket and was the school captain for about two years. Opening bowler in College at one point too...

In my spare time, I do freelance work, work on my projects or start new projects from my never ending list of ideas I keep in my little black book, play video games, or play with some technology.

I was born in Jamaica, grew up pretty much around the world. Lived in other Caribbean islands and countries in the EU such as Antigua (Caribbean), Germany and UK where I now live.

I am currently in the process of writing my first book(might take a while, loads of more exciting things going on), with any luck I will be able to base my final year project on some of its contents as well as scalable architectures.

That in a nutshell is who I am :-)
