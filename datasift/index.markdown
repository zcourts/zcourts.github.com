[DataSift](http://datasift.com) is an awesome start up based in Reading, UK.
Back in 2011 I took a year off Uni. and worked there for a year as a placement student.

I liked it there because I worked on all sorts a stuff. If you know me you know I don't like working on the same old thing forever. At DataSift I worked with 4 or 5 languages, built services, APIs, played with our massive Hadoop/HBase cluster and more...

A year on I went back to Uni, graduated with a 1st class BEng Software Engineering, attempted my own [start up](http://fillta.com) and chilled.
On the 8th of August I started back at DataSift as a permanent full time employee. Doing what I do best.

Right now I'm sat here writing  service tests with our open source [Storyplayer](http://datasift.github.io/storyplayer/) testing tool.
I'm going to update this page with a bunch of stuff including current job openings at DS.
